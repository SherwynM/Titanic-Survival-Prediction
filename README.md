# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic disaster. The model is built using the XGBoost algorithm and trained on the well-known Titanic dataset.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features to improve model performance (optional).
- **XGBoost Model Training**: Train an XGBoost model to predict passenger survival.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy or F1-score.
- **(Optional) Web Application**: Deploy the model as a web application for interactive prediction (if applicable).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional)

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).
3. Run the Python script (e.g., `main.py`) to train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. (Optional) Refer to additional instructions for deploying the model as a web application.
