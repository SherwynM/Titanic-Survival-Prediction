# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic disaster. The model is built using the XGBoost algorithm and trained on the well-known Titanic dataset.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Create additional features to improve model performance (optional).
XGBoost Model Training: Train an XGBoost model to predict passenger survival.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy or F1-score.
(Optional) Web Application: Deploy the model as a web application for interactive prediction (if applicable).
Requirements:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional)
Instructions:

Clone this repository.
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (if provided).
Run the Python script (e.g., main.py) to train the model and evaluate its performance.
(Optional) Refer to additional instructions for deploying the model as a web application.
Further Exploration:

Experiment with different hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
Try other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Visualize the model's performance and feature importance.
Data Source:

The Titanic dataset is publicly available from various sources. You can find it on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) or UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
